# Write a program that performs the tasks of a simple calculator. The program should first take an integer as input and then based on that integer perform the task as given below.
# 1. If the input is 1, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their sum is printed.
# 2. If the input is 2, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their difference(1st number - 2nd number) is printed.
# 3. If the input is 3, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their product is printed.
# 4. If the input is 4, then 2 integers are taken from the user and the quotient obtained (on dividing 1st number by 2nd number) is printed.
# 5. If the input is 5, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their remainder(1st number mod 2nd number) is printed.
# 6. If the input is 6, then the program exits.
# 7. For any other input, then print "Invalid Operation".
